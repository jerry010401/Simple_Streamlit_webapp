# My First Streamlit App

A simple demo app built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) that welcomes a user by name and lets them select their age.

## 📄 Overview

This project demonstrates a basic use of Streamlit to turn a Python script into an interactive web application — without needing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.  
The app displays a title and header, asks for the user’s name, greets them if provided, and includes a slider to select age.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Python 3.x  
- Streamlit package

### Installation

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
